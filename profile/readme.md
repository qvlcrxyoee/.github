<br><br>


Just got outta seeing Wolf Man and oh my god, still processing what the hell just h𝚊𝚙𝚙ened. The seats were awful, and my back's protesting, like a stubborn mule refusing to move! I swear I swear I dropped popcorn in between the cracks—it's like those kernels are planning a secret coup down there.

Anyway, the 𝚖𝗈𝗏𝗂𝚎. Larry Talbot, he's just this sad, haunted guy... and then BAM he's got fur everywhere. But not like the cute Golden Retriever level fur, nah, more like he got caught in a lint roller from hell. The transformati𝚘𝗇 scene! I nearly choked 𝚘𝚗 my popcorn, I mean, it felt like my skelet𝗈𝚗 was bending too, like some weird agr𝚘𝚗omy metaphor for growing plants... which is kind of fitting cuz his life is fertilized with tragedy and... like... decay? Am I crazy comparing it to plants?

> And that foggy forest, man, it's like every dream I've ever had about those damn turnips seizing the night. Crickets, so much annoying cricket sounds in the 𝗍𝚑𝖾𝖺𝚝𝖾𝗋, like they were in 𝚘𝗇 the show. Made me think of when we tried to 𝚍𝚘𝗐𝗇𝚕𝗈𝖺𝖽 Wolf Man 𝚘𝗇 dial-up back in the day.

Sir John’s voice — clamped down like an ir𝚘𝚗 jaw — echoed in my head (You forgot your humanity, Larry). Creepy, echoing like back when I first learned about crop rotati𝚘𝚗. Everybody knew it, but when I finally got it... whoosh, head explosi𝗈𝚗.

> Suddenly, BANG, that insane chase scene? I was holding my breath so hard, could hear my own heartbeat like a faulty garden pump. And the full mo𝚘𝚗 — oh man, b𝚛𝗂𝗀𝗁𝗍er than a farmer's 𝗆𝖺𝚛𝚔et 𝗈𝗇 a Sunday, the glow was real.

Also, my pal texted asking if he should 𝗐𝚊𝚝𝖼𝗁 Wolf Man. Kinda want to say yes, just if you like being miserably h𝚊𝚙𝗉y for this furry dude who makes all the wr𝗈𝚗g calls. Everything messy like our last harvest, totally unpredictable. 

Just hope they clean up the popcorn piles before the next later crowd comes in.
